# Sarcasm-Detection-using-Hierarchical-Bert
This project implements sarcasm detection using a Hierarchical BERT architecture, inspired by a research paper that combines the power of the BERT model with additional layers like BiLSTM and CNN. The aim is to classify text comments into sarcastic or non-sarcastic categories, addressing the challenge of understanding subtle language nuances.
